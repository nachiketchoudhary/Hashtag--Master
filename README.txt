Name:           HashTag: Parse and Identify Password Hashes


Description:    HashTag.py is a python script written to parse and identify password hashes.  It has three main arguments which consist of identifying a single hash type (-sh), parsing and identifying multiple hashes from a file (-f), and traversing subdirectories to locate files which contain hashes  and parse/identify them (-d). Many common hash types are supported by the CPU and GPU cracking tool Hashcat.  Using an additional argument (-hc) hashcat modes will be included in the output file(s).
